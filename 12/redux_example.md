Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, primarily used with libraries like React or Angular for managing global state. It provides a centralized store to store and manage application state, making it easier to manage and update state across different components.

Redux follows a unidirectional data flow architecture and emphasizes immutability and pure functions. It is based on three core principles:

Single Source of Truth: Redux maintains the application state in a single JavaScript object called the "store." The entire state of the application is stored as a single plain JavaScript object, allowing easy access and manipulation of the state from any part of the application.

State is Read-Only and Immutable: The state in Redux is immutable, meaning it cannot be directly modified. Instead, to update the state, you dispatch actions, which are plain JavaScript objects describing what happened in the application. The state is updated by pure functions called "reducers," which take the current state and an action and return a new state without modifying the original state.

Changes are Made with Pure Functions: Redux uses pure functions called reducers to handle state updates. Reducers take the current state and an action as input and return a new state. They should be pure functions, which means they should only depend on their input and not have any side effects.

By following these principles, Redux helps to enforce a predictable and manageable way of handling application state. It allows you to separate the concerns of state management from your components, making your application more maintainable and testable.

Key components of Redux include:

Store: The central repository that holds the application state.
Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe an event or an intention to change the state.
Reducers: Pure functions that take the current state and an action and return a new state.
Dispatch: A function used to send actions to the Redux store, triggering state updates.
Connect: A function that connects React components to the Redux store, allowing them to access the state and dispatch actions.
Overall, Redux provides a powerful and scalable solution for managing application state in JavaScript applications, promoting a single source of truth and predictable state updates. It's particularly beneficial for larger applications with complex state management needs.

To create a redux example application:

Set up a new React project or use an existing one. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your project directory:
```
npm install react react-dom react-redux redux
```

Create a new file called index.js and add the following code:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';

// Step 3: Define Redux reducers
const initialState = {
  count: 0
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(reducer);

// Step 5: Connect React components to Redux store
class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { count, increment, decrement } = this.props;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
  decrement: () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
});

const ConnectedCounter = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

// Step 6: Wrap the root component with the Provider and provide the Redux store
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <ConnectedCounter />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Create an HTML file, such as index.html, in the same directory and add the following code:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>React Redux Counter</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Open the HTML file in a web browser, and you should see a counter with buttons to increment and decrement the count value. The state of the counter is managed by Redux.

The example sets up a Redux store using createStore from the 'redux' package. It defines a reducer that handles incrementing and decrementing the count state. The connect function is used to connect the Counter component to the Redux store, allowing it to access the state and dispatch actions. The root component, ConnectedCounter, is wrapped with the Provider component from React Redux to provide the Redux store to all connected components. The rendered result is inserted into the div with the id "root" in the HTML file.

By clicking the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons, the count value will be updated and displayed in the UI.
