## Set up

This course works and has been tested on both macOS and Windows 10. It also will work very well on Linux (just follow the macOS instructions). You shouldn't need a particularly powerful computer for any part of this course. 8GB of RAM would more than get you through it and you can likely get away with less.

- Install Node.js. Make sure your version of Node.js is at least 14, preferably the latest stable release. I prefer using nvm to install Node.js, [see setup instructions here][nvm]. I'll be using Node.js 18.
- While you do not have to use [Visual Studio Code][vsc], it is what I will be using and I'll be giving you fun tips for it along the way. I was on the VS Code team so I'm a bit biased!

## How the repo works

There are two repos for this class: [the website you're currently on][site] and [the example projects][projects].

Every step of this project will have a folder that will be a snapshot of where the project is at that step. If you get stuck, want to copy/paste some long bit of code you don't feel like writing, or just want to walk through the code at that point, please do! The primary goal of this is for you to learn so as long as you're learning there's no cheating!

The naming format will be `XX-<name of the lesson>` so you can get a rough idea of order and which lesson the step is coming from. In each snapshot you'll have to run `npm install` again since it'll literally just be another whole copy of the project.

For the Intermediate classes they're just called `<section>` since most of them don't have steps. The ones that do are `<section>-X`.
